# Learning [Svelte kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and building this project
Took me ~7 hours.

## How to start the project

After clonning this repo, go to the project repository and run:

```bash
npm install
```
Then
```
npm run dev
```
# Or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
```
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
